Greenhouse - Doors and PVC pipes by seakintruth on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5934347

The custom greenhouse design is a clever and inventive approach to repurposing old doors and reducing the quantity of lumber required for construction. Utilizing doors as the primary building material not only lessens waste in the environment but also lends a distinctive and charming character to the greenhouse. Please note that this design is not intended for printing and is instead intended for constructing a full-scale building. Prior to starting construction, please verify the local building permit requirements.

In addition to the doors, the design features a PVC hoop roof, which is a lightweight and cost-effective roofing option. The flexible PVC pipes are easy to bend into the desired shape, allowing for a range of different roof styles and configurations. This makes the greenhouse design highly customizable, allowing you to tailor it to your specific needs and preferences.

Overall, this greenhouse design is an excellent example of how you can repurpose materials and reduce waste while still creating a functional and aesthetically pleasing structure. By using doors and PVC pipes, you can build a greenhouse that is both unique and environmentally friendly.

## Roof customization

Setting the $fn parameter to 4 creates a gabled roof design, while setting it to a higher value, such as 80, creates a round roof design.

### Round Roof
This greenhouse design features a circular roof, which provides several benefits for growing plants. The rounded shape allows for optimal light distribution and heat retention, creating a more consistent and stable environment for plants to thrive. Additionally, the circular design eliminates corners where cold air can collect and cause drafts, ensuring a more even temperature throughout the greenhouse. 

### Pitched Roof
The design of the shed with a pitched roof can be useful as a greenhouse for a wide audience for several reasons:

- Cost-effective: The design uses easily available and affordable materials, which makes it cost-effective for those who want to build a greenhouse on a budget.

- Versatility: The shed design is versatile and can be adapted to suit a wide range of greenhouse uses. For example, it can be used to grow a variety of plants, from vegetables to flowers.

- Size: The design can be adjusted to fit a wide range of sizes, making it suitable for those who have limited space, as well as those who have more space available.

- Good Ventilation: The design incorporates a gable roof that provides good ventilation, which is essential for maintaining the ideal growing environment for plants.

- Natural Light: The design allows plenty of natural light to enter the greenhouse, which is important for plant growth and health.

### Easy to Build

Both designs are easy to build, even for those who have limited experience in construction. The sturdy wood frame and recycled doors provide durability and insulation, while the raised foundation allows for easy drainage and ventilation. Whether you're a seasoned gardener or just starting out, this round-roof greenhouse is a great option for growing a wide variety of plants and extending your growing season.

Overall, these designs can be an excellent option for a wide audience looking for a cost-effective, versatile, and easy-to-build greenhouse that provides good ventilation and natural light.

## Background as a Lesson Plan
Greenhouses are essential structures for anyone interested in growing plants, especially in areas with unfavorable weather conditions. However, the cost and complexity of designing and building a greenhouse that meets specific needs can be a barrier for many people.

To address this, we've developed a customizer design for a greenhouse that is made from many doors, minimal lumber, and a PVC hoop roof. This design is super customizable and adaptable to fit a range of sizes, making it an affordable and accessible option for anyone interested in greenhouse gardening.

The circular shape of the round roof greenhouse design provides optimal light distribution and heat retention, making it perfect for growing a wide variety of plants. The sturdy wood frame and polycarbonate panels make it durable and well-insulated, while the raised foundation allows for easy drainage and ventilation. For those who prefer a pitched roof, our design is cost-effective, versatile, and easy-to-build. The gable roof provides excellent ventilation, and there's plenty of natural light to keep your plants healthy and thriving.

We're continuously working to improve this design, and we're planning to add additional wood rafters after a specified length and calculate the height of the rafters based on the ellipse created by the width of the shed and height of the roof. These features would make the design even more functional and stable, so stay tuned for updates.

In this lesson plan, students will learn the basic principles of greenhouse design and how to customize a design to fit specific needs. They will also learn how to use OpenSCAD desktop and Visual Studio Code plugins to create a 3D model of their own customized greenhouse design. Additionally, students will understand how the design of a greenhouse can impact ecosystem dynamics, functioning, and resilience, and evaluate or refine a technological solution that reduces the impacts of human activities on natural systems.

By the end of this lesson, students will have a better understanding of greenhouse design principles and the importance of considering environmental factors such as light, temperature, and ventilation in plant growth. They will also have gained skills in problem-solving and collaboration, as well as the ability to apply their knowledge to their own gardening projects.
